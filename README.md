This Streamlit app written in Python lets users enter a California address and checks if it falls within eligible city or county boundaries for coupons. It uses ArcGIS to convert the address into coordinates, then queries official boundary services (from endpoints.json) to see if the location matches a city or county. The app displays the results in real time, showing the matched city and county or noting if none are found.
